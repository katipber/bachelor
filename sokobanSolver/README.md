# Sokoban Solver

This is a small program to solve basic [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) puzzles.

During implementation bitmaps and [BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) are used.

In the project documentation two versions of the program are mentioned. The one uploaded here is the upgraded version of the program.
